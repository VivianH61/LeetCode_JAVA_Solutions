"""
height of tree for different node as root:
the max path from root to child nodes

find the root that has min height tree

Approach 1: Topological Sorting
=ã€‹ need to find the nodes thatare overall close to all other nodes, especially the leaf nodes

initialize
since its undirected, for each node, maintain a list of neighbors

At beginning, put all leaf nodes into the queue
recursively remove leaf node from the tree
